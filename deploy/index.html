                Sea Glass is glass that was littered into the ocean many years ago, and through the transformative powers of the ocean becomes a beautiful, smooth and clouded jewel. Some other names that people call sea glass include “beach glass,” “mermaid tears,” and “sea gems” among others! It’s likely you’ve seen or even picked up some of these during a stroll on the beach.

                How It's Made
            </h2>
            <p>
                Once glass is tossed into the ocean, its transformation into true sea glass can take anywhere from 5 to 50+ years! Waves will move the glass to a shore. From here, the glass will be smoothed out over the course of years by being roughed up against sand and rocks by the waves in a process called tumbling. The glass will slowly have components leeched out of it by the salt water and will be bathed in sunlight, which gives sea glass its distinctive frosted look.
