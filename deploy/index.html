                Sea Glass is glass that was littered into the ocean many years ago, and through the transformative powers of the ocean becomes a beautiful, smooth and clouded jewel. Some other names that people call sea glass include “beach glass,” “mermaid tears,” and “sea gems” among others! It’s likely you’ve seen or even picked up some of these during a stroll on the beach.

                How It's Made
            </h2>
            <p>
                Once glass is tossed into the ocean, its transformation into true sea glass can take anywhere from 5 to 50+ years! Waves will move the glass to a shore. From here, the glass will be smoothed out over the course of years by being roughed up against sand and rocks by the waves in a process called tumbling. The glass will slowly have components leeched out of it by the salt water and will be bathed in sunlight, which gives sea glass its distinctive frosted look.

                                Different colors of glass are made with different minerals, so different colors of sea glass are consist of different minerals! Understanding what materials makes up each of your pieces of sea glass can add some fun historical context to them.

                Finding Beaches
            </h2>
            <p>
                When looking for a place to look for sea glass, it is important to take in mind both the history and landscape of the location. Places that are more highly populated or have a history of factories typically will have more sea glass due to an increased likelihood of litter. In terms of landscape, the beach must not be flat since this makes it hard for the glass to tumble. The waves at the beach should be 1-2 feet tall at least to ensure there is proper force to tumble the glass.
