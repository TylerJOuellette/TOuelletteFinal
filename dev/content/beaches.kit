            When looking for a place to look for sea glass, it is important to take in mind both the history and landscape of the location. Places that are more highly populated or have a history of factories typically will have more sea glass due to an increased likelihood of litter. In terms of landscape, the beach must not be flat since this makes it hard for the glass to tumble. The waves at the beach should be 1-2 feet tall at least to ensure there is proper force to tumble the glass.
