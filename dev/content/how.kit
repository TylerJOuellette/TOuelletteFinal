            How It's Made

        <p>
            Once glass is tossed into the ocean, its transformation into true sea glass can take anywhere from 5 to 50+ years! Waves will move the glass to a shore. From here, the glass will be smoothed out over the course of years by being roughed up against sand and rocks by the waves in a process called tumbling. The glass will slowly have components leeched out of it by the salt water and will be bathed in sunlight, which gives sea glass its distinctive frosted look.
