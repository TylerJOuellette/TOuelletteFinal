            Sea Glass is glass that was littered into the ocean many years ago, and through the transformative powers of the ocean becomes a beautiful, smooth and clouded jewel. Some other names that people call sea glass include “beach glass,” “mermaid tears,” and “sea gems” among others! It’s likely you’ve seen or even picked up some of these during a stroll on the beach.
